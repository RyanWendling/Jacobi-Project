# Jacobi-Project
This program uses Jacobi Iteration as a means of solving Laplace's Equation. Jacobi operates on a matrix of values representing some propert. The parameter of the matrix has fixed known values. The interior cells, however, are unknown. The goal of Jacobi Iterations is to assign values to these interior cells that are in a steady state
