# Jacobi-Project
Uses Jacobi Iteration and concurrency (threads, synchronization) to solve Laplace's Equation. Jacobi operates on a matrix of values with a perimeter of known values. The interior cells, however, are unknown. The goal is to assign values to these interior cells with a gradual “bleed-in affect”. Engineered in Java
